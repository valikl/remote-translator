1. Added "Local" button near "To channel" settings. This button will toggle channel where you are 
   hearing your counterparts (others translators at same language).
    a. If not pressed "To channel" settings will applied for destination channel i.e. if 2     
       translators are remote, than you will hear second translator (This is what previous versions 
       are providing)
    b. If pressed "To channel" settings will applied for destination channel located under source 
       folder. This option is suitable when 1 person translating locally from BB, and the other one 
       is remote. Case Julio provided us. The obstacle to always use this options is that you will 
       hear yourself as well with some delay (~1-2 sec) so it is very unpleasant to use it constantly. 
       Use Target mute button when you are translating :) 

2. We've increased priority of our "audio" threads and decreased priority to our "video" thread. 
   Hopefully this should solve or minimize problems Julio reporting with audio cut offs during translations.
