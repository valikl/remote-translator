 * @defgroup initclient Client Initialization
 *
 * @brief The first thing a user application must to is call
 * #TT_InitTeamTalk which will return a #TTInstance-pointer which
 * is a new client instance.
 *
 * #TT_InitTeamTalk takes as parameter a HWND which will have messages
 * posted whenever an event in the client instance takes place. These
 * are the events defined in #ClientEvent. If the end-user application
 * is console-based the function #TT_InitTeamTalkPoll can be used
 * where events are processed using #TT_GetMessage.
 *
 * When a new client instance is created a call to #TT_GetFlags will
 * show that the client initially is in state #CLIENT_CLOSED. This
 * means that no operation has been performed on the client.
 *
 * Querying #TT_GetFlags call can be used by a user application as a
 * state-machine to show which actions are currently possible for the
 * user application. The #ClientFlag enumeration shows the information
 * which can be retrived though #TT_GetFlags.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup sounddevices Sound Capture and Playback
 * @brief This section explains how to record and playback audio
 * in the client instance.
 *
 * Before being able to initialize the sound devices to use for
 * recording and playback the computer's available sound devices must
 * first be queried. This is done using the functions
 * #TT_GetSoundInputDevices and #TT_GetSoundOutputDevices. These two
 * functions return arrays of #SoundDevice-structs which contains a
 * description of the sound device. In the #SoundDevice-struct there's
 * a member variable called @a nDeviceID. This ID should be passed to
 * the client instance's two sound initialization functions
 * #TT_InitSoundInputDevice and #TT_InitSoundOutputDevice. Once this
 * has been done the #TT_GetFlags call will return a value containing
 * the mask bits #CLIENT_SNDINPUT_READY and #CLIENT_SNDOUTPUT_READY.
 *
 * A computer's default sound devices can be queried using
 * #TT_GetDefaultSoundDevices. A loop-back test of the selected sound
 * devices can be performed using #TT_StartSoundLoopbackTest.
 * 
 * Be aware that the sound devices might fail if e.g. a USB sound
 * device is unplugged while the client is talking in a channel. In
 * this case ensure the application is processing the errors
 * #INTERR_SNDINPUT_FAILURE and #INTERR_SNDOUTPUT_FAILURE in the
 * #WM_TEAMTALK_INTERNAL_ERROR event.
 *
 * Read section @ref transmission to see how to transmit recorded
 * audio to other users.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup videocapture Video Capture and Image Display
 *
 * @brief This section explains how to initialize a video device
 * and display captured images on the user's display.
 *
 * The client is able to capture video and present them to the user
 * application in RGB32-format and transmit the image in encoded
 * format to other users.
 *
 * @section vidcapinit Initialize Video Capture Device
 *
 * To capture video the user application must first query the
 * available capture devices by calling #TT_GetVideoCaptureDevices. A
 * #VideoCaptureDevice supports a certain number of capture formats
 * each described in the @a captureFormats member of #CaptureFormat.
 *
 * Once a device has been chosen the #TT_InitVideoCaptureDevice must
 * be called for the client instance to start capturing video
 * frames. Use the @a szDevice member of #VideoCaptureDevice as the
 * device identifier for the video capture device and pass a
 * #CaptureFormat from the @a captureFormats array of
 * #VideoCaptureDevice. The @a lpVideoCodec parameter of
 * #TT_InitVideoCaptureDevice can be passed as NULL if the captured
 * video frames do not need to be transmitted. Check out section @ref
 * codecs on how to configure the video codec.
 *
 * @section vidcapdisplay Display Captured Video
 *
 * When a video frame becomes available the event
 * #WM_TEAMTALK_USER_VIDEOFRAME is posted to the application and
 * #TT_GetUserVideoFrame can be used to extract the RGB32 image. On
 * Windows it's also possible to call #TT_PaintVideoFrame to make the
 * client instance paint on a HWND by getting its HDC.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup codecs Audio and Video Codecs
 *
 * @brief The client is able to encode audio in Speex and CELT
 * format whereas video can be encoded in <a
 * href="http://www.theora.org">Theora</a> format. Speex is
 * recommended for voice and CELT for music.
 *
 * Choosing the right codec settings in an end-user application is
 * very important and proper settings depend entirely on the user
 * scenario. Always ensure that the codec settings do not require too
 * much bandwidth and thereby resulting in packetloss causing
 * inaudible conversations and poor video quality. Detecting
 * packetloss can be done using #UserStatistics and #ClientStatistics.
 *
 * Note that bandwidth usage will be much higher when running in peer
 * to peer mode since each client must then broadcast data to all
 * users instead of having the server forward the audio and video
 * packets. Checkout the section @ref connectivity on the different
 * types of connections.
 * 
 * Every channel must configure which audio codec to use in order for
 * users to be able to talk to each other. The @a codec member of
 * #Channel specifies which audio codec (#AudioCodec) should be
 * used. A channel does not restrict the video codec (#VideoCodec)
 * users are using.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup desktopshare Desktop Sharing
 *
 * @brief A user can transmit a desktop window to other users in a
 * channel by passing the handle of a window to the TeamTalk client
 * DLL. The TeamTalk client then converts the window to a bitmap image
 * which is transmitted to the server. The server then forwards the
 * bitmap image to all other users in the channel.
 *
 * @section desktoptx Send Desktop Window (or bitmap)
 *
 * Before sending a desktop window to a channel the handle
 * (identifier) of the window to share must first be found. Windows,
 * Mac and Linux (X11) have different ways of locating the window
 * handle.
 *
 * Instead of using a window handle it's also possible to simply send
 * a raw bitmap by calling TT_SendDesktopWindow().
 *
 * @subsection desktopwin Windows Desktop Sharing
 *
 * TeamTalk for Windows provides the following functions for
 * obtaining different @c HWNDs:
 *
 * - TT_Windows_GetDesktopActiveHWND()
 *   - Get the @c HWND of the window which has focus.
 * - TT_Windows_GetDesktopHWND()
 *   - Get the @c HWND of the Windows desktop.
 * - TT_Windows_GetDesktopWindowHWND()
 *   - Enumerate all visible windows.
 * - TT_Windows_GetWindow()
 *   - Get information about a window, e.g. window title, size, etc.
 *
 * Once the @c HWND of the window to share has been found use the
 * following function for sending the window to the channel:
 * 
 * - TT_SendDesktopWindowFromHWND()
 *
 * @subsection desktopmac Mac OS Desktop Sharing
 *
 * TeamTalk for Mac OS provides the following functions for obtaining
 * desktop window handles:
 *
 * - TT_MacOS_GetWindow()
 *   - Enumerate all active windows.
 * - TT_MacOS_GetWindowFromWindowID()
 *   - Get information about a window, e.g. window title, size, etc.
 *
 * Once the handle (@c CGWindowID) of the window to share has
 * been found use the following function for sending the window to the
 * channel:
 *
 * - TT_SendDesktopFromWindowID()
 *
 * @subsection desktopx11 Linux Desktop Sharing
 *
 * TeamTalk for Linux does not provide helper functions for getting
 * the handle of a X11 window. This is in order to avoid linking the
 * TeamTalk DLL to X11. Instead it is recommended to check out @ref
 * qtexample which shows how to convert X11 windows to bitmaps and use
 * TT_SendDesktopWindow() for transmission.
 * 
 * @section desktopshow Displaying Shared Desktop Window (or bitmap)
 *
 * When a shared desktop window is received the event
 * #WM_TEAMTALK_USER_DESKTOPWINDOW is posted to the local client
 * instance.  TT_GetUserDesktopWindow() can then be called to obtain
 * a bitmap image of the shared window.
 *
 * @section desktopcursor Desktop Cursor Sharing
 *
 * It is also possible to share the position of the mouse cursor when
 * sharing a desktop window. Use TT_SendDesktopCursorPosition() to
 * transmit the position of the mouse cursor. When the position is
 * received the event #WM_TEAMTALK_USER_DESKTOPCURSOR is posted to the
 * local client instance. TT_GetUserDesktopCursor() can then be used
 * to obtain the cursor position.
 * 
 *
 * @defgroup events Client Event Handling
 *
 * @brief When events occur in the client instance, like e.g. if a new
 * user joins a channel, the client instance queues a message which
 * the user application must retrieve.
 *
 * If #TT_InitTeamTalk is used with a HWND then the events are sent to
 * the user application with WinAPI's PostMessage(...)  function and
 * is retrieved through GetMessage(...).
 * 
 * If a HWND is not used then events can instead be retrieved through
 * #TT_GetMessage.
 *
 * Note that when an event occurs the TeamTalk client instance doesn't
 * wait for the user application to process the event. So if e.g. a
 * user sends a text-message and immediately after disconnects from
 * the server, then the text-message cannot be retrieved since the
 * user is no longer available when the user application starts
 * processing the new text-message event. This is, of course, annoying
 * when designing the user application, but the reason for this design
 * choice it that the client instance is a realtime component which
 * cannot wait for the UI to process data, since audio playback and
 * recording would then be halted.
 *
 * The section @ref stepbystep gives a good idea of how events are
 * processed in a user application.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup errorhandling Client Error Handling
 *
 * @brief There are two types errors which can occur in the client,
 * either server command error or internal errors. Section @ref
 * commands describes all the commands a client can issue to a
 * server. If a server commands fails the client instance notifies the
 * user application through the event #WM_TEAMTALK_CMD_ERROR. An
 * example of a server command error could be to issue the #TT_DoLogin
 * command with an incorrect server password. The server will in this
 * case respond with the error #CMDERR_INCORRECT_SERVER_PASSWORD. The
 * user application must be designed to process these errors so
 * application users can be notified of errors.
 *
 * Internal errors are errors due to failing devices. Currently only
 * two such errors exist #INTERR_SNDINPUT_FAILURE and
 * #INTERR_SNDOUTPUT_FAILURE.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup connectivity Client/Server Connectivity
 *
 * @brief To communicate with a server the TeamTalk client creates
 * both a TCP and UDP connection to the server. Commands, i.e. the
 * TT_Do*-functions, are sent on TCP whereas audio and video are sent
 * on UDP.
 *
 * To connect to a server the user application must call
 * #TT_Connect. Once connected the event #WM_TEAMTALK_CON_SUCCESS is
 * posted to the user application and the #TT_DoLogin command can be
 * issued. Always ensure to call #TT_Disconnect before attempting to
 * create a new connection with #TT_Connect.
 *
 * When the client instance has joined a channel and wants to transmit
 * audio or video data to other users this can be done in two ways
 * depending on how the user application configures the client. One
 * way is forward through server and the other is peer to peer mode
 * which are explained in the following two sections.
 *
 * @section txforward Forward Through Server Transmission Mode
 *
 * By default the client instance is sending its audio and video
 * packets to the server and the server will then broadcast the
 * packets to the other users on behalf of the client. In other words
 * the client puts the bandwidth load onto the server. This approach
 * has its advantages and disadvantages. Since most internet
 * connections nowadays have limited upstream they cannot broadcast
 * audio and video packets to numerous users at the same time, so
 * therefore the default behaviour of the TeamTalk client is to have
 * the server do the broadcasting. This means that the server must
 * have sufficient bandwidth available to handle data transmission
 * from and to all the connected users. One disadvantage by having the
 * server forward the audio and video packets is that it doubles
 * latency, since the client doesn't send directly to other clients.
 *
 * If the server should not allow clients to forward audio and video
 * packets the @a uUserRights member of #ServerProperties must disable
 * #USERRIGHT_FORWARD_AUDIO and #USERRIGHT_FORWARD_VIDEO. Doing so means
 * that clients connecting must use peer to peer connections in order
 * to communicate. Note that the client doesn't automatically switch
 * to peer to peer mode, but relies on the user application to call
 * #TT_EnablePeerToPeer.
 *
 * @section txp2p Peer to Peer Transmission Mode
 *
 * By calling #TT_EnablePeerToPeer the client instance will attempt to
 * create peer to peer connections to all users it's communicating
 * with. This reduces latency since the client will then broadcast the
 * audio and video packets itself, so they do not have to be forwarded
 * through the server.
 *
 * The event #WM_TEAMTALK_CON_P2P is posted to the user application if
 * a peer to peer connection either fails or succeeds. If a peer to
 * peer connection fails the client will send through the server to
 * that user given that the server allows it, i.e. if
 * #USERRIGHT_FORWARD_AUDIO or #USERRIGHT_FORWARD_VIDEO is enabled.
 *
 * If the server does not allow users to forward audio and video
 * packets and the peer to peer connection to a user fails, then that
 * user will be unavailable for audio and video data. So beware of
 * this when configuring the server and client.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup commands Client/Server Commands
 *
 * @brief This section contains the list of commands which can be
 * issued by the client instance to the server.
 *
 * @section cmdprocessing Client/Server Command Processing
 *
 * Functions with the prefix TT_Do* are commands which the client can
 * issue to the server. Every TT_Do* function returns a command
 * identifier which can user application can use to check when the
 * server has finished processing the issued command. Once the client
 * receives a response to a command the client instance posts the
 * event #WM_TEAMTALK_CMD_PROCESSING to the user application
 * containing the command identifier and whether the command is being
 * processed or it has completed.
 *
 * As an example, say the user application wants to issue the
 * #TT_DoLogin command. When the application calls #TT_DoLogin the
 * returned command ID is stored in a variable. The application then
 * waits for the #WM_TEAMTALK_CMD_PROCESSING event to be posted with
 * the stored command ID. The first time #WM_TEAMTALK_CMD_PROCESSING
 * is posted to the user application it is to say that processing has
 * begun. The second time #WM_TEAMTALK_CMD_PROCESSING is called it is
 * to say that the command has completed. In between the command
 * starting and completing several other events may take place. If
 * e.g. the #TT_DoLogin fails the user application would receive the
 * event #WM_TEAMTALK_CMD_ERROR. If on the other hand the command was
 * successful all the channels and user would be posted as events to
 * the application before the login-command completed processing.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup transmission Audio and Video Transmission
 *
 * @brief Once the client instance has joined a channel it can
 * transmit audio and video to other users in the channel. When
 * transmitting audio and video it is important to be aware of how the
 * client is configured to do this. Sections @ref txforward and @ref
 * txp2p explains the two supported data transmission modes.
 *
 * To transmit audio the client must have the flag
 * #CLIENT_SNDINPUT_READY enabled which is done in the function
 * #TT_InitSoundInputDevice. To transmit video requires the flag
 * #CLIENT_VIDEO_READY which is enabled by the function
 * #TT_InitVideoCaptureDevice. To hear what others users are saying a
 * sound output device must have been configured using
 * #TT_InitSoundOutputDevice and thereby have enabled the flag
 * #CLIENT_SNDOUTPUT_READY.
 *
 * Calling #TT_EnableTransmission will make the client instance start
 * transmitting either audio or video data. Note that audio
 * transmission can also be activated automatically using voice
 * activation. This is done by called #TT_EnableVoiceActivation and
 * setting a voice activation level using #TT_SetVoiceActivationLevel.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup server Server Properties
 *
 * @brief The server keeps track of which users are in which channels
 * and ensures that users in the same channel can communicate with
 * each other. It is also the job of the server to provide user
 * authentication so only users with the proper credentials are
 * allowed to do certain operations.
 *
 * It is a good idea to check out section @ref serversetup to learn
 * how to configure the TeamTalk server.
 *
 * The server can be configured in a number of ways using the
 * #ServerProperties-struct. Only users who are logged on to the
 * server as administrators can change a server's properties while
 * it's running. This is done using the command #TT_DoUpdateServer.
 *
 * The @a uUserRights bitmask in #ServerProperties specifies what
 * users are allowed to do. The server can e.g. be configured to only
 * allowed users who have an account to log on by disabling the flag
 * #USERRIGHT_GUEST_LOGIN. If default users (without administrator
 * rights) shouldn't be allowed to create channels this can be
 * disabled by disabling the flag #USERRIGHT_CHANNEL_CREATION.
 *
 * @section useradmin User Administration
 *
 * Two types of users exists on a server, default users and
 * administrator users. The #UserType-enum can be used to see who is
 * what. To be administrator the user must have a user account on the
 * server with the #USERTYPE_ADMIN flag set.
 *
 * As administrator it is possible to list all users who have an
 * account on the server using #TT_DoListUserAccounts. To create a new
 * user account call the command #TT_DoNewUserAccount and to delete an
 * account call #TT_DoDeleteUserAccount.
 *
 * @section userban Kicking and Banning Users
 *
 * Sometimes it may be necessary to kick and ban users from a
 * server. As administrator it is possible to use the command
 * #TT_DoKickUser to kick a user off the server. A channel operator
 * can also kick a user from a channel (but not off a server).
 *
 * As administrator it is also possible to ban users from the server,
 * so they can no longer log in. This can be done using
 * #TT_DoBanUser. To list who are currently banned call #TT_DoListBans
 * and to remove a ban call #TT_DoUnBanUser.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup channels Channel Properties
 *
 * @brief Users are arranged in a tree structure consisting of
 * channels where each channel can hold a number of users. While
 * in a channel users can transmit audio and video to each other
 * as well as sending channel messages. On a server there will
 * always be a root channel which cannot be deleted.
 *
 * In other conferencing tools channels are also refered to as
 * "rooms".
 *
 * @section chanadmin Channel Administration
 *
 * To create a new channel on a server an administrator can call
 * #TT_DoMakeChannel whereas a default user (without administrator
 * rights) has to use #TT_DoJoinChannel to create a new channel. Using
 * #TT_DoJoinChannel creates a dynamic channel which disappears again
 * from the server when the last user leaves the channel. The first
 * user to join a dynamic channel will become operator of the channel,
 * meaning that he can kick user and make other operators as well.
 *
 * Updating a channel's properties can only be done by administrators
 * and operators of the channel and this is done by using
 * #TT_DoUpdateChannel.
 *
 * To remove a channel a user must be administrator and can do so by
 * calling #TT_DoRemoveChannel.
 * 
 * @section filesharing File Sharing
 *
 * While in a channel users can upload and download files. To upload a
 * file to a channel the channel needs to have a disk quota. The disk
 * quota is specified by @a nDiskQuota in the #Channel-struct. The
 * file being uploaded must have a file size which is less than the
 * disk quota and the sum of sizes of existing files. Once a file is
 * uploaded only administrators, channel operators and the file's
 * owner can delete a file. Note that the file's owner must have an
 * account on the server to delete the file.
 *
 * Call #TT_DoSendFile to upload a file and #TT_DoRecvFile to download
 * a file. Only users who have a #UserAccount on the server are
 * allowed to upload files. There is no limit on the maximum number of
 * file transfers but it is advised to queue file transfers so the
 * file transfers do no affect server performance.
 *
 * @section voicelog Storing Conversations to Audio Files
 *
 * In some applications it may be required to be able to save all
 * audio data received by the client instance to disk. This can be
 * archived by calling #TT_SetUserAudioFolder which will then save
 * received audio data in the following format: "YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
 * \#USERID USERNAME.wav". USERNAME is the @a szUsername from #User.
 *
 * To store audio data from outside the local client instance's
 * channel, please read section @ref spying.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup users User Properties
 *
 * @brief Users can be seen on the server after a successful call
 * to #TT_DoLogin. Once logged in a user can send user to user
 * text-messages using #TT_DoTextMessage as well as receive
 * broadcast messages. A user cannot send audio and video data to
 * other users until they have joined the same channel.
 *
 * @section usertypes User Types
 *
 * A user can either be a default user #USERTYPE_DEFAULT or an
 * administrator #USERTYPE_ADMIN. A default user has limited rights on the
 * server whereas an administrator can change server properties,
 * create, delete and remove channels as well as move, kick and ban
 * users.
 *
 * @section userinteract User Interaction
 *
 * Once a user has joined a channel it is possible to transmit audio
 * and video data to other users. If a user starts talking in the
 * channel the event #WM_TEAMTALK_USER_TALKING is posted to the user
 * application and if a video frame is received the event
 * #WM_TEAMTALK_USER_VIDEOFRAME is sent to the user application.
 *
 * @section uservolume User Audio Settings
 *
 * While in the same channel the user application can change different
 * settings on a user. If e.g. a user's volume is too low the user
 * application can call #TT_SetUserVolume to increase the volume. If
 * it's still not loud enough #TT_SetUserGainLevel can be called to
 * use software to amplify the volume level.
 *
 * If on the other hand the user application wants to mute a user
 * #TT_SetUserMute can be used for this. Note that muting a user
 * doesn't mean that the client instance will stop receiving audio
 * from that user, it simply means it will not be played. To stop
 * receiving audio from a user the local client instance must ask the
 * server to unsubscribe audio data from the user. This is explained
 * in the next section.
 *
 * @section subscriptions User Subscriptions
 * 
 * When logging on to a server the local client instance will by
 * default subscribe to user messages, channel messages, broadcast
 * messages, audio data and video data from all users. If, however, a
 * client wants to stop receiving e.g. audio from a user, he can call
 * #TT_DoUnsubscribe along with the user ID and the
 * #SUBSCRIBE_AUDIO-flag to tell the server that he no longer wants to
 * receive audio from that user. The server will then respond with the
 * event #WM_TEAMTALK_CMD_USER_UPDATE and the @a uLocalSubscriptions
 * member of #User will have the #SUBSCRIBE_AUDIO-flag removed. At the
 * remote user the \a uPeerSubscriptions member will be
 * changed. Subscribe/unsubscribe can also be done for user, channel
 * and broadcast messages and video data. The function #TT_DoSubscribe
 * can be used to revert unsubscriptions.
 *
 * @subsection spying Spying on Users
 *
 * Previously it has been said that users can only receive audio and
 * video from users when they are in the same channel, but actually an
 * administrator user can call #TT_DoSubscribe with the flags prefixed
 * SUBSCRIBE_INTERCEPT_* to spy on users outside his own channel. In
 * other words it's possible hear and see video data outside ones
 * channel. Also all user and channel messages sent by a user can also
 * be intercepted in this way.
 *
 * Having the ability to intercept all data sent from users in any
 * channel means that it's possible to log everything that is
 * happening on the server. Both audio and video transfers as well as
 * text messaging. Checkout #TT_SetUserAudioFolder on how to store
 * voice data to audio files.
 *
 *
 * @defgroup hotkey Windows Hotkeys
 *
 * @brief Hotkeys can be used to e.g. enable push-to-talk.
 *
 * Windows supports intercepting key strokes globally, i.e. without
 * having the user application's window focused. To investigate which
 * keys are currently being pressed the function
 * #TT_HotKey_InstallTestHook can be used. Once the desired
 * key-combination has been found the function #TT_HotKey_Register can
 * be used to register the combination as a hotkey and have the
 * #WM_TEAMTALK_HOTKEY event posted whenever the key combination
 * becomes active.
 *
 * Note that it's not advised to have a hotkey installed while
 * debugging an application in Visual Studio. It slows down the
 * debugger dramatically.
 * 
 *
 * @defgroup mixer Windows Mixer
 *
 * @brief The Windows mixer can be manipulated so e.g. Line In can be
 * chosen instead of Microphone for recording.
 *
 * To find the mixer which is associated with the current sound input
 * or output device the @a nWaveDeviceID member of #SoundDevice must
 * be used when querying the mixer.
 *
 * @defgroup firewall Windows Firewall
 *
 * @brief The Windows Firewall can be modified so applications can be
 * added to the firewall's exception list.
 *
 * The Windows Firewall was introduced in Windows XP SP2. Modifying
 * the Windows Firewall requires administrator rights. On Windows XP
 * the user running the application, which calls the DLL, is assumed
 * to have administrator rights. On Windows Vista/7 the DLL will
 * automatically call User Account Control (UAC) to obtain
 * administrator rights.
 *
 * Check out TT_Firewall_AddAppException() on how to add application
 * executables to the Windows Firewall exception list.
